      <div class="about-content">

        <p>Civil Engineering Department, Acropolis Institute of Technology and Research (AITR) is one of the best departments
          in Central India. The department is well equipped with highly qualified faculties and state-of-art laboratories.
          Some of the specialties of the department are mentioned below:
    
          Civil engineering laboratories have NABL accreditation (DST, Govt. of India) for Construction Material Testing,
          NDTs and for Geo-technical investigations. Ours is the only Institute in Central India which has got this
          recognition. It gives opportunity to the students to get actual work exposure time to time, and enables them to
          understand the concepts in a better way. Civil Engineering Testing Laboratory is also an approved facility by the
          MP State Government (PIU-PWD, MPAKVN, MPRDC, REC, etc.) for quality checks of the construction projects in all the
          districts of M.P.</p>
    
    
          <p>In order to keep the students updated as per industry requirements, we do train them on various civil engineering
          software which among others include
         <ol>
          <li>AutoCAD</li>
           <li>StaadPro</li>
            <li>Primevera</li>
          <li>MSP etc</li>
         </ol> 
    </p>
  
        <p>In addition to these trainings, students do have the access to about 40 other civil engineering software which
        they may specifically choose to work on</p>
  
        <p>Department does organize technical seminars, workshops and trainings time-to-time to keep the students aware of
          any new development. To name a few technical and awareness events organized in the recent past are:
    <UL>
      <li>Workshop on Green Building Recognition Systems (GRIHA & IGBC)</li>
      <li> Technical Seminar on Storm Drainage System Designing and Software Application</li>
      <li> National Summit on Smart Cities and Urban Planning</li>
      <li>Workshop on Advanced Surveying Techniques</li>
      <li>Workshop on Building Design</li>
      <li>Workshop on Concrete Mix Design</li>
      <li>Technical Seminar on Smart Construction Materials and Structural Health Monitoring</li>
    <li>National Seminar on Construction Industry and Smart Development</li>
    <li>Seminar on Preparing Technical Workforce of Tomorrow in collaboration with ISTE (MP-CG Section)</li>
    <li>SMARTathon: A Marathon to Make the City Smart</li>
    <li> Theme: Sanitation and Public Hygiene (Swachcha Bharat Abhiyan), Smart Utility of Water, Air Pollution Control,</li>
     <li>Traffic Sensitization, Moral Values and Ethics (Women Empowerment, Protecting Public Property etc.)
    </li>
     <li> SMARTmove: Smart Citizens Smart City, Cycle Rally-cum-Walkathon
      Theme: Clean City, Green City, Be Fit to be Hit, Save Energy, Save Fuel, Traffic Sensitization, Moral values and
      Ethics</li>
</UL>
    On-site industrial trainings during summer vacation and, industrial visits on a regular basis are arranged for the
          students, enabling them to get the practical exposure at construction project sites.
          The department can boast of excellent team of faculty members from top national level institutions including IIT
          and NITs. Many well experienced technocrats and academicians also come regularly to teach the students as visiting
          faculty.
    
    
          The department offers B.E. and Diploma in civil engineering with an intake of 120 and 60 students respectively.
          The credibility of the department has also been indicated at admission counseling, as many top students opt to
          join our courses by giving first preference.
    
          The Acropolis Groupâ€™s another college (i.e. Acropolis Technical Campus) situated at Indore itself also offers B.E.
          Civil Engineering with an intake of 120 students.
    
          Consultancy (Material Testing): A material testing lab has been developed. The lab is Equipped with all necessary
          testing machines including UTM,CTM,CBR and Impact Testing Machines etc. The department specializes in highway
          material testing and in concrete mix-design for various structures as per the quality of available materials.</p>
